# The Most Dangerous Writing App Windows Desktop Version

A desktop version of the open source version of [The Most Dangerous Writing App](https://github.com/maebert/themostdangerouswritingapp) built using [Nativefier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/tree/master). It works exactly the same as the [webapp](https://maebert.github.io/themostdangerouswritingapp/), except when you click the download button in the app, your writing will be saved directly to your downloads folder without notification.

The Electron app is too big for Github so you can download it as a zipfile [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/itmyjys6dgeewzi/The%20Most%20Dangerous%20Writing%20App-win32-x64.zip?dl=0).

Unzip the application folder and run "The Most Dangerous Writing App.exe".
