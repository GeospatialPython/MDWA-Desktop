# The Most Dangerous Writing App Windows Desktop Version

A desktop version of the open source version of [The Most Dangerous Writing App](https://github.com/maebert/themostdangerouswritingapp) built using [Nativefier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/tree/master). It works exactly the same as the [webapp](https://maebert.github.io/themostdangerouswritingapp/), except when you click the download button in the app, your writing will be saved directly to your downloads folder without notification.
